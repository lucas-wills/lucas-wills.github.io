    <h3>HTML, CSS and DOM</h3>
    <p>I think that HTML, CSS and DOM can be likened to almost any construction analogy.
       But my analogy is going to involve cake.
       HTML is like the cake recipe. It has a list of all the ingredients required to bake the cake. Perfect.
       DOM is the actual method for baking the cake/the structure and steps that need to be followed in order to get the cake you want with the given ingredients.
       And then lastly is the CSS, which is the icing on the cake!
       Not a good pun, but atleast the analogy tastes good...</p>

   <h3>Boxifying</h3>
    <p>Boxifying is the simple process of taking elements you find on a webpage or design brief and, starting with the largest elements,
       placing them inside boxes. The process includes adding boxes to more and more specific elements until you’re satisfied with the number of
       squares you’ve created. This allows developers to more easily visualize how they should layout elements on a page.</p>

  <div class="boxmodel">
   <h3>The Box Model</h3>
   <p>The box model is the recognition that there is a box around each element you find on a webpage. Knowing that everything is contained within boxes
      makes thinking about website layout simpler and less intimidating.</p>
