          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>I think the EDA experience is dictated by the mindset
             of the individual. If you treat it as a learning experience,
             without the common fears of not being good enough, or being too good,
             you will get the most out of your time. If you approach the
             programme with a "kitchen mindset" as Shereef explained as oppposed
             to a "restaurant mindset" you will be achieving the desired effect.
             Even if you are the least knowledgable or completely new to all the subject materials,
             it doesnt matter. If you're willing to in there and get your hands
             dirty and make mistakes with the rest of your cohort, you will be successful.
          </p>
          <p>I have always been a shy person. I don't talk much and have always been bad
             at asking for help when I need it. But, I know that in order to engage with
             the EDA culture this will have to change. I am devoted to better myself.
             I will engage with my cohort and the programme in the desired way,
             and will do my best to improve my communication skills and quash any
             fears of failure or inadequacy. I will get the most I can out of this experience.
          </p>
          <p>My expectations of EDA have not changed. Coming into the programme I had a good
             idea of the what the learning environment would be like, and how it was driven
             by the idea of learning and inclusivity. Everything I have heard or read about
             EDA and the programme, only confirmed what I had heard.</p>
          <p>I am excited to be a part of the EDA experience. And I'm also very nervous.
             I'm nervous because of the social aspects of the course, because of my incredibly
             introverted nature, but I'm also excited because I believe that the kind of learning
             environment encouraged by the programme is one that will actually help me learn most effectively.
          </p>

          <h3>Time and Habits</h3>
          <p>The techniques I tried were mainly meditation and Pomodoro.
             And out of the two I enjoyed meditation the most. I was having trouble
             linking my css file with my html, and nothing seemed to be working.
             So I figured I would leave it, and try some meditation to cool off
             and then hopefully come back to the problem with some clarity
             and less frustration. It actually worked too. I found that coming
             back to it fresh allowed me to look at the problem anew, and I
             was actually able to identify what was wrong and rectify it.
          </p>
          <p>I think I want to try doing some more meditation, but instead of just
             when I need a break I'm going to try and do it regurly and just work
             it into my daily routine. Some of the benefits they said that persist
             through doing meditation such as reduced anxiety and increased focus sounded
             very appealing to me.
