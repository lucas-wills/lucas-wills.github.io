     <h3>Grid Based Design</h3>
     <p>Grid based design is when you apply a grid structure to inform the layout of your pages. Generally you have a grid
      which is 12 columns across, because this gives you the flexibility to create content which evenly covers
      1/12, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, or the whole page.

     <h3>Responsive Webpages</h3>
     <p>Responsive webpages are cool! A responsive webpage is one which changes depending on the size of the screen on which
      you’re viewing the page. These changes could be to the size or layout of elements on the page, and could offer you a
      very different experience based on the device you’re viewing it on. Responsive Web Design is very important because so
      many people are using tablets and phones to view webpages. A design might look and work fine on your average computer
      screen, but shrunk down to the size of a phone screen it might become difficult to view or use. This is why responsive
      web design is so important! It allows all users of a website to have a positive experience using the same webpage.

    <h3>Semantic Structure</h3>
    <p>An element which is semantic describes what it is clearly to both browsers and developers. It is a tag which clearly
     defines its content to people looking at it which makes it easier for the developer to visual and categorize the different
     elements while still having the desired effect when viewed through a browser. Semantic structure is using specific tags in
     the place of more general tags with the same function, in order to make it easier for people to understand.
