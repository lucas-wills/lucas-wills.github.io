           <h3>Mindfulness and Self-Awareness</h3>
           <p> There is a strong linear relationship between mindfulness and self awareness.
             As your mindfulness increases your emotional intelligence increases too.
             It provides clarity into your emotions and inner workings.
             I tried to do the body scan. It was for the most part a success, as it's pretty
             much like practising mindfulness, just making the focus of your mindfulness different
             parts of your body. My concentration wasn't perfect, but I tried.
             I thought the "my emotions are not me" section was very interesting. I hadn't thought
             about how we usually say "I am angry" instead of "I am feeling angry", and was intrigued
             by the discussion of viewing emotions as an experience and something you can control.
             I like to think that I have good control over my emotions and sort of tend to think
             this way already. I think it's important in order for people to keep their calm cool.

           <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
           <p>During the first week when I was just starting to learn CSS I ran into a problem.
             I was doing an exercise in which I had to change the colour of a word to red.
             So I wrote what I believed the appropriate code was but it didn't work.
             I looked through everything again, and it seemed fine, so I tried again to no success.
             Refreshed the page and tried again, still nothing. I was quite frustrated by this point,
             so I decided to just leave it for a bit and come back. So I did and when I returned I read
             through the instructions again and looked at my code, and it clicked.
             I had written "color" the New Zealand english way instead of the American way.
             Which is why it took me so long to find out why it wasn't working. The error was only an
             error to people who use American english, so I would see it and not register any problem.
             It was so silly, and wasn't the only time it happened either.
             I can't think of an example of a problem I solve elogantly...
             I'll keep it in mind as we move forward though.
           </p>

             Psuedo-code is good. When times are tough something simple and approachable is nice.
             I enjoy trying things. I'll often just jump in and try a few things and see what sticks.
             It's not always the best way of doing things, but I like it.
             I think the rubber ducky method is a good one, and it's what I usually do when I'm doing
             Javascript and trying to work through a problem. It helps me lay out all the different
             things that are going on in an clear and understandble way.
             I've never paid a whole lot of attention to the specifics of error messages to be honest.
             I would just see that there is an error, and then try to fix it. Not that error messages
             aren't helpful, I just dont usually look at them too hard before trying to find a solution.
             Console logging is useful. And easy too!
             I google almost everything all the time. I especially like watching walkthroughs
             because I get a lot from actually seeing someone doing whatever task it is I'm trying to do.
             It usually means that there are less mistakes and more clarity. Google is the best.
             I have never been very good at asking for help. At school it was because I had very smart
             friends so I probably developed some sort of inferiority complex haha. I don't like standing
             out or bringing attention to myself, but unfortunately that isn't a good way to problem solve.
             The squeaky wheel gets the oil!
             Reflection is a great thing. A very important part of doing something is realising what you
             did well and where you can improve. So I do make sure to take notes of things I need to
             better, or habits I need to kick. Basically I want to do the best I can at everything I do,
             so first I need to know what I'm doing badly.

             <code>.map</code> looks for a query that you've specified and then makes an array with what it finds.
           </p>
           <p>
             <code>.filter</code> looks for a query that you've speficfied and then checks to see if it meets specific parameters,
             and if it does, it'll put the results in a new array.
           </p>
           <p>
             <code>.reduce</code> makes arrays more simple by combining all of the elements it contains.
