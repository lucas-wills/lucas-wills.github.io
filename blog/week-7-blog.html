           <h3>Pleasure, Passion and Purpose</h3>
           <p>I found out when I started to think about my different pursuits in life currently,
              that most of the things I do are for pleasure haha.
              Like playing video games or watching things on youtube, hanging out with friends
              and EaTIng.
              I used to have a couple hobbies that I was passionate about; things that I could
              do that just gave me inherent happiness, but I don't seem to be doing them much lately
              and I'm not sure why. For example I'm a big fan of miniature wargames, but I haven't
              painted any miniatures for atleast a month now. And I have a great book that I was reading
              but I stopped at some point and I don't know why.
              I thought for a second there I had nothing left that I was doing currently that I am passionate
              about, but then I realised that I had just put down my ukulele after playing a couple songs,<br>
              so atleast I've got that.
           </p>
           <h3>Core Values</h3>
           <p>Call me old fashioned, but I find great value in Loyalty and Respect.
              I believe that showing respect is something that everyone can and should do.
              For example when I was at primary it always bugged me when my classmates would
              be mucking around or simply not listening to what the Teacher was saying.
              It bothered me because all they had to do was listen and keep their mouths shut;
              two things that are incredibly easy but for some reason it was beyond them.
              If a person is talking to you, you should be listening to them.
              If a person asks you something you should try and answer them.
              It all comes back to treating others how you would want to be treated.
              Loyalty is also important to me because I think it's very important to remember
              things that people have done for you. It's not easy to go through life alone,
              in fact a lot of us depend on help from people around us to achieve our goals.
              So when I say loyalty I mean acknowledging when people have done something for you
              and trying to give back to those people in some way at some point.
           </p>
           <h3>What I stand for</h3>
           <p>Something that I believe is really important is equality. There isn't a specific
              equality that I preach; I just believe in equality in general. It is confusing
              that in this day age there are still judgements and segregations which are completely
              baseless and pointless. It's just DUmB. We are all people and deserve to get treated as such!
           </p>
           <h3>Resilience Ideas</h3>
           <p>I like how a lot of the ideas in Search Inside Yourself are linked to mindfulness.
              Since we've all been practising mindfulness we all have the base knowledge to learn
              resilience too. Inner calm is a direct result of mindfulness training, and is the bases
              of resilience. Which means that you just need to know when to apply mindfulness to a
              situation to help improve the situation and your resilience.<br>
              Emotional resilience is recognising that failure and success are both emotional experiences,
              with physiological effects.
              Which is a very familiar concept; almost identical to what was taught in the self-regulation
              segment which spoke about recognising signs of anger and so on. So knowing when and how you
              react to success and failure is a key part of building resilience. Sounds right to me.
              And then finally we have cognitive resilience which is creating the conditions for optimism.
              Which I guess is thinking about what you have done and why it ended in failure, in order
              to grow and move towards success. Using a calm and rational mind to determine how to make
              changes which lead to a better outcome.
              I think that the resilience ideas are very solid, and I think that the fact that they mirror
              mindfulness and other teachings from previous segments shows how closely knit a lot of the
              ideas are when it comes to emotional competencies and intelligence.
