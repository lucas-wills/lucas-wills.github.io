           <h3>Triggered?</h3>
           <p>I get triggered when I cause errors and I have no idea why they're happening.
              For example in a previous blog I described my experience with trying to make
              something change colour and not knowing why it wouldnt.
              That was so frustrating to me because I searched and searched but could not
              see what the problem was. When I think I've done everything right but it doesn't
              work, I get triggered.<br>

              I think the Siberian North Railroad method is really solid. I tried it when I was feeling
              frustrated and overwhelmed by the tasks ahead, and it helped me settle down and
              start working again. It worked kind of like a reset button; rebooting and functioning
              back at normal capacity.

           <h3>JavaScript Symbols</h3>
           <p>Parentheses in JavaScript are used to contain parameters within functions:<br>
              <code>var = function ()</code><br>
              You can also use them in mathematical equations to ensure the different
              components of the equation are done in the correct order:<br>
              <code>3 + 2 + (4 x 5) = 25</code><br>
           </p>
           <p>Square brackets are used in arrays:<br>
              <code>var Array = [1, 2, 3]</code><br>
              They are also used when you want to access a specific item
              within an array:<br>
              <code>Example[0]</code>
           </p>
           <p>Curly braces are used to house code blocks.
              They indicate the start and end of a piece of code
              such as a function:<br>
              <code>var nap = function (){...}</code>

           </p>
           <p>Both single quotes and double quotes are used to contain strings of text:<br>
             <code>console.log("This is a string!")</code><br>
              Either can be used to house a string, but it's best to use the same one
              throughout for the sake of consistency.<br>
           </p>
