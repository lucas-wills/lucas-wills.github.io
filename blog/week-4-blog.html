           <h3>Javascript vs HTML</h3>
           <p> Javascript is a lot harder than html and css. There is so much more content and so many more interactions that you need
             to learn. It's pretty overwhelming really. Control flows and loops is when you have a function or something that you
             want to happen, but only when the correct conditions are met. It's like doing laundry. You follow the specific steps
             of putting clothes in the washing machine, then the powder, and then you turn it on. Then you have to keep checking it until
             it's finished, and only once th washing machines finished do you take the washing and hang it outside.
             Data arrays are a collection of values and are accessed from the array via "indexing". Each data point within the array
             is given a number starting from 0, so all you need do is refer to the specific number within the array when you want to call it.
             When you want to call a piece of data within an object it is different, you must refer to it by its name.
             A function in Javascript is a set of instructions and parameters used to find a value or complete a task.
             Functions are very common and all have unique names which you can use to call them.

           <h3>Minfulness Conversation</h3>
           <p>I thought it was a very interesting exercise. It kind of reminded me of being in school; listening intently and as if
             I could be asked a question by the teacher at any moment. It certainly helped me retain the conversation better, and reduce
             misunderstandings by atleast 17%. Huge success.
             To practice mindfulness I will continue trying these sorts of conversations with my brother and continue doing 2 minutes
             of mindfulness a day.
