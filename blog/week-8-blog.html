           <h3>Loving Kindness</h3>
           <p>I thought the loving kindness exercise was interesting. I did it with the focus being on my
             closest friend, and it caused me to consider him in a different way.
             I love this friend of mine, he's a well respected individual who is smart and can be very funny.
             But he is also a bit of a bastard who can really get on my nerves some times.
             And even though he is my best friend, I have never really considered him to share many
             similarities with me. But after doing this exercise it's obvious that we are much more alike
             than I realised. But then so too are all of us really. The same motives drive us; we all want to be happy.
           </p>
           <h3>Empathetic listening</h3>
           <p>My attempts at reading my brothers emotions were fairly accurate, but obviously I know my brother very
              well and we've been close friends our entire lives. But still, I guess it just comes down to realising
              that what you would feel in certain situations is probably very similar to what others would feel also.
           </p>
           <h3>Political Awareness</h3>
           <p>Ahhhhh, I can't recall a specific scenario in recent memory where I've argued with someone..
              and usually my arguments aren't "real" arguments, there just me trying to get back at my sister.
              It definitely happens, I just can't recall.. I could make one up I guess, but thats kind of
              redundant... I will update this next time I get into an argument haha.
           </p>

           <h3>Scope</h3>
           <p>Scope in Javascript is very important, and refers to the ability to access functions and variables
              depending on their position in the code relative to each other.
              A variable or function can either have local or global scope.
              If it is global it exists outside of a function, and is data that can be accessed by any other function
              or variable. Whereas if it is within a function it is local and can only be accessed specifically within that function.
