           <h3>Responsive Sites</h3>
           <p>A responsive site is one that changes size and/or layout relative to the size of the screen being used
              to view it. So Ideally the users would have a good experience on any sized device, even though it may not be the same experience.
           </p>
           <h3>Frameworks: Pros and Cons</h3>
           <p>Frameworks provide prebuilt functionality that can save you a lot of time and effort. This means that you can make sites quicker and more efficiently.
              This is very useful because it can cut the time needed to code a page significantly, saving you time and your client money ;D
              I guess one the negative aspects of this is it’ll make you lazier when it comes to coding. Considering theres a lot of handy prebuilt tools at your
              disposal, you wont be learning as much as you would be if you weren’t using a framework. Another thing is when you use a framework you have to work
              within its limitations and play by its rules. This could possibly limit you and your design.
           </p>
           <h3>Mobile First Desgin</h3>
           <p>I think that HTML, CSS and DOM can be likened to almost any construction analogy.
              But my analogy is going to involve cake.
              HTML is like the cake recipe. It has a list of all the ingredients required to bake the cake. Perfect.
              DOM is the actual method for baking the cake/the structure and steps that need to be followed in order to get the cake you want with the given ingredients.
              And then lastly is the CSS, which is the icing on the cake!
              Not a good pun, but atleast the analogy tastes good...
          </p>
          <h3>Boxifying</h3>
          <p>Mobile first design is when you first and foremost consider how your design will behave on a smaller screen, and making sure that your design is easily able
             to transform to accommodate becoming smaller.
          </p>
          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          <p>A wireframe is like a rough sketch or image that represents the placement and size of elements on your website. It’s basically like a blueprint that’s either
             sketched on paper or drawn on a computer using a programme to roughly block in a site design. My wireframes were very simple, because
             my design is also very simple. So it didn’t give me too much trouble when I came to translating my wireframe into an actual design.
          </p>

          <h3>Process over Product</h3>
          <p>Process over product is my ideal way to design a page. I think there is a lot of beauty in simplicity, and think that not overburdening the user with too
             many things to look at can really make a very streamlined and enjoyable experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Thoughts on Meditation</h3>
          <p>I didn’t think much about meditation before I watched the second part of Search Inside Yourself. I always thought that there might be some merit to it,
             but not anything particularly practical or something that could apply to me. But I was wrong. It was fascinating to think of meditation as cultivating
             skills that lead to a better quality of life. From increased happiness to better auto-immune responses, there are a lot of different things that you
             can gain from doing meditation; a lot of which is backed up by scientific experiments and data. I thought it was very interesting and is something
             that I will definitely try. I’m not sure I can sit in the lotus position though haha. I’ll have to practice that one.
