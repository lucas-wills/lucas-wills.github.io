     <h3>What did I learn</h3>
     <p>I gained a deeper understanding and knowledge of the different kinds of intelligences that people can have.
       It was a kind of popular idea when I was at primary school; the idea that different people were strong in
       different areas, and just because you might not have the same cognitive ability as your peers didnt mean
       you weren't smart in other ways. I found it interesting how much it was stressed that emotional intelligence
       is something that can be taught and practiced, and how emotional competencies are more vital to personal
       success in all aspects of your life than pure cognitive ability. I read the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself
       and watched the video too. It was so interesting I'll probably watch the rest!

     <h3>2 Minutes of Mindfulness</h3>
     <p>I really enjoyed doing the 2 minutes of mindfulness. I very much agree with the philosophy of enjoying each and
       every moment for what it is, and being happy. Because life is a gift! The chance of existing is impossibly small,
       but people are so busy that they often forget to appreciate things like that. Which is why I think that practicing
       mindfulness is incredibly beneficial for a persons wellbeing. And as Chade-Meng Tan said, it is very easy to do.
       Anyone can spend 2 minutes of their day simply focusing on their breathing and appreciating it for what it is.
       I am definitely going to practice mindfulness every day.
