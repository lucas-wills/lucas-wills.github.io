           <h3>What did I learn</h3>
           <p>I gained a deeper understanding and knowledge of the different kinds of intelligences that people can have.
             It was a kind of popular idea when I was at primary school; the idea that different people were strong in
             different areas, and just because you might not have the same cognitive ability as your peers didnt mean
             you weren't smart in other ways. I found it interesting how much it was stressed that emotional intelligence
             is something that can be taught and practiced, and how emotional competencies are more vital to personal
             success in all aspects of your life than pure cognitive ability. I read the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself
             and watched the video too. It was so interesting I'll probably watch the rest!
           </p>
           <h3>2 Minutes of Mindfulness</h3>
           <p>I really enjoyed doing the 2 minutes of mindfulness. I very much agree with the philosophy of enjoying each and
             every moment for what it is, and being happy. Because life is a gift! The chance of existing is impossibly small,
             but people are so busy that they often forget to appreciate things like that. Which is why I think that practicing
             mindfulness is incredibly beneficial for a persons wellbeing. And as Chade-Meng Tan said, it is very easy to do.
             Anyone can spend 2 minutes of their day simply focusing on their breathing and appreciating it for what it is.
             I am definitely going to practice mindfulness every day. </p>

           <h3>HTML, CSS and DOM</h3>
           <p>I think that HTML, CSS and DOM can be likened to almost any construction analogy.
              But my analogy is going to involve cake.
              HTML is like the cake recipe. It has a list of all the ingredients required to bake the cake. Perfect.
              DOM is the actual method for baking the cake/the structure and steps that need to be followed in order to get the cake you want with the given ingredients.
              And then lastly is the CSS, which is the icing on the cake!
              Not a good pun, but atleast the analogy tastes good...</p>
          <h3>Boxifying</h3>
           <p>Boxifying is the simple process of taking elements you find on a webpage or design brief and, starting with the largest elements,
              placing them inside boxes. The process includes adding boxes to more and more specific elements until you’re satisfied with the number of
              squares you’ve created. This allows developers to more easily visualize how they should layout elements on a page.</p>
          <h3>The Box Model</h3>
           <p>The box model is the recognition that there is a box around each element you find on a webpage. Knowing that everything is contained within boxes
              makes thinking about website layout simpler and less intimidating.</p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <h3>Grid Based Design</h3>
           <p>Grid based design is when you apply a grid structure to inform the layout of your pages. Generally you have a grid
              which is 12 columns across, because this gives you the flexibility to create content which evenly covers
              1/12, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, or the whole page.</p>
          <h3>Responsive Webpages</h3>
           <p>Responsive webpages are cool! A responsive webpage is one which changes depending on the size of the screen on which
              you’re viewing the page. These changes could be to the size or layout of elements on the page, and could offer you a
              very different experience based on the device you’re viewing it on. Responsive Web Design is very important because so
              many people are using tablets and phones to view webpages. A design might look and work fine on your average computer
              screen, but shrunk down to the size of a phone screen it might become difficult to view or use. This is why responsive
              web design is so important! It allows all users of a website to have a positive experience using the same webpage.</p>
          <h3>Semantic Structure</h3>
           <p>An element which is semantic describes what it is clearly to both browsers and developers. It is a tag which clearly
              defines its content to people looking at it which makes it easier for the developer to visual and categorize the different
              elements while still having the desired effect when viewed through a browser. Semantic structure is using specific tags in
              the place of more general tags with the same function, in order to make it easier for people to understand.</p>
