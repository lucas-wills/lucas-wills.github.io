    <h3>Reflection<h3>
    <p>I think the EDA experience is dictated by the mindset
      of the individual. If you treat it as a learning experience,
      without the common fears of not being good enough, or being too good,
      you will get the most out of your time. If you approach the
        programme with a "kitchen mindset" as Shereef explained as oppposed
        to a "restaurant mindset" you will be achieving the desired effect.
        Even if you are the least knowledgable or completely new to all the subject materials,
        it doesnt matter. If you're willing to in there and get your hands
        dirty and make mistakes with the rest of your cohort, you will be successful.</p>
    <p>I have always been a shy person. I don't talk much and have always been bad
      at asking for help when I need it. But, I know that in order to engage with
      the EDA culture this will have to change. I am devoted to better myself.
      I will engage with my cohort and the programme in the desired way,
      and will do my best to improve my communication skills and quash any
      fears of failure or inadequacy. I will get the most I can out of this experience.</p>
    <p>My expectations of EDA have not changed. Coming into the programme I had a good
      idea of the what the learning environment would be like, and how it was driven
      by the idea of learning and inclusivity. Everything I have heard or read about
      EDA and the programme, only confirmed what I had heard.</p>
    <p>I am excited to be a part of the EDA experience. And I'm also very nervous.
      I'm nervous because of the social aspects of the course, because of my incredibly
      introverted nature, but I'm also excited because I believe that the kind of learning
      environment encouraged by the programme is one that will actually help me learn most effectively.</p>
