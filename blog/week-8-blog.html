           <h3>Loving Kindness</h3>
           <p>I thought the loving kindness exercise was interesting. I did it with the focus being on my
             closest friend, and it caused me to consider him in a different way.
             I love this friend of mine, he's a well respected individual who is smart and can be very funny.
             But he is also a bit of a bastard who can really get on my nerves some times.
             And even though he is my best friend, I have never really considered him to share many
             similarities with me. But after doing this exercise it's obvious that we are much more alike
             than I realised. But then so too are all of us really. The same motives drive us; we all want to be happy.
           </p>
           <h3>Empathetic listening</h3>
           <p>My attempts at reading my brothers emotions were fairly accurate, but obviously I know my brother very
              well and we've been close friends our entire lives. But still, I guess it just comes down to realising
              that what you would feel in certain situations is probably very similar to what others would feel also.
           </p>
           <h3>Political Awareness</h3>
           <p>Something that I believe is really important is equality. There isn't a specific
              equality that I preach; I just believe in equality in general. It is confusing
              that in this day age there are still judgements and segregations which are completely
              baseless and pointless. It's just DUmB. We are all people and deserve to get treated as such!
           </p>

           <h3>Scope</h3>
           <p>Scope in Javascript is very important, and refers to the ability to access functions and variables
              depending on their position in the code relative to each other.
              A variable or function can either have local or global scope.
              If it is global it exists outside of a function, and is data that can be accessed by any other function
              or variable. Whereas if it is within a function it is local and can only be accessed specifically within that function.
