    <p>The techniques I tried were mainly meditation and Pomodoro.
        And out of the two I enjoyed meditation the most. I was having trouble
        linking my css file with my html, and nothing seemed to be working.
        So I figured I would leave it, and try some meditation to cool off
        and then hopefully come back to the problem with some clarity
        and less frustration. It actually worked too. I found that coming
        back to it fresh allowed me to look at the problem anew, and  I
        was actually able to identify what was wrong and rectify it.</p>
    <p>I think I want to try doing some more meditation, but instead of just
        when I need a break I'm going to try and do it regurly and just work
        it into my daily routine. Some of the benefits they said that persist
        through doing meditation such as reduced anxiety and increased focus sounded
        very appealing to me.</p>
